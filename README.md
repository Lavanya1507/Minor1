Route planning is of utmost importance for travel and transportation, with the aim of determining the 
best path among given locations. There is an increased need for intelligent systems that can process 
huge data sets, consider various factors such as distance, time and cost, and produce optimal routes due 
to the complexity of transportation networks. 
The aim of this project is to develop an application that uses graph data structures in order to represent 
locations as nodes and travel routes as edges. With advanced graph traversal and shortest path 
algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, A* algorithm, and Bellman-Ford algorithm; this application will 
compute very efficiently the most optimal travel routes between two or more destinations. In addition, 
it will enhance user experience by taking into account numerous variables like travel time, cost as well 
as personal preferences so as to create tailor made travel solutions. 
The importance of this project is based on its capacity to reduce traveling time, decrease expenditure 
on transport while enhancing the use of resources which makes it beneficial for singles travellers, 
logistics companies or even town planners. In light of increasing demands for intelligent means of 
transport henceforth; it is therefore the aim of this project to help develop better and smarter tools for 
planning journeys.
